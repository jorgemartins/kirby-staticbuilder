Best practices for static sites
===============================


Kirby is not originally a static site generator, so some things that work on a dynamic Kirby-powered website might not work in a static HTML export. This guide helps you avoid common issues.


## Avoid hardcoded URLs and file references

StaticBuilder tries to generate correct URLs (absolute or relative, depending on options) for links and file references, but it can only work with URLs that go through Kirby or the `url()` helper function.

Avoid hardcoded URLs such as:

```php
<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/styles.css">
```

You could use the `url()` helper instead:

```php
<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= url('assets/css/styles.css') ?>">
```

Similarly, when linking to pages, use the `url()` method:

```php
<!-- Bad :( -->
<a href="/blog">Blog Archive</a>

<!-- Better :) -->
<a href="<?= page('blog')->url() ?>">Blog Archive</a>
```


## Avoid or work around dynamic features

If you plan to export your site as static HTML files, like you would do with a [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/) (Jekyll, Hugo, Sculptin, Pelicanâ€¦), you should know that not all features will be doable on a static site. A few common pain points:

-   search results;
-   contact forms;
-   advanced routing;
-   logged-in users;
-   etc.

You should list all the features of your website and try to determine if they need to be dynamic:

-   Do you need to process user input (e.g. a form), and show different content depending on what the user entered?
-   Do you need to connect to a database to show always up-to-date content?
-   Etc.

For each dynamic feature, you could try to find a workaround. But if you have many such features, then a static site generator (including this plugin) is probably not for you. ;)

Possible workarounds:

-   Search: JSON index generated by Kirby + custom JS code, or using a third-party such as Algolia ([Kirby plugin](https://github.com/getkirby-plugins/algolia-plugin)).
-   Forms: [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) or other third-party services.
